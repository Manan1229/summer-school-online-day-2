Project: Personal Profile Card

Files Included:
1. index.html – Contains the HTML structure for the profile card. Note that an inline style is applied to the main container for its background color.
2. style.css – Contains all the external CSS, which handles the majority of styling for the project.
3. readme.txt – Explains the CSS approaches and selectors used.

CSS Types Used:
- Inline CSS: A style attribute on the profile card container is used to apply a background color.
- External CSS: All other styling properties (layout, typography, colors, hover effects, etc.) are defined in "style.css".

CSS Selectors Implemented:
- Element Selectors: Styles applied directly to elements such as the body, ul, h1, h2, and p.
- Class Selectors: Used to style elements with a reusable class, including ".profile-card" for the main container and ".bio" for the bio paragraph.
- ID Selector: "#profile-pic" is used to uniquely style the profile image.
- Group Selectors: A combined selector (h1, h2) groups heading tags to share common style attributes.
- Descendant Selectors: ".contact p" targets <p> elements that are children of the .contact section.
- Attribute Selectors: "a[href]" specifically targets all anchor (<a>) tags with an href attribute, which allows for consistent styling of links and hover effects.

Design Philosophy:
The design adopts a modern yet personal color palette—a clean white background, dark blue headings, soft gray text, and vibrant teal accents for interactive elements—to create a sleek and engaging profile card.

Repository Naming:
Ensure your GitHub repository follows the designated naming convention (e.g., "summer-school-online-day-2") and remains public for submission.
